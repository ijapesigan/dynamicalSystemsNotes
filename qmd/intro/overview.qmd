## Important concepts

- **System**: A set of interrelated variables.
- **Dynamical system**: A system in which the present state of the system depends on the previous states of the system.
- **State space**: A $p$-dimensional space constituted by all possible values taken on by the variables of a system over an exteded period of time.
- **Initial conditions**: A selected starting point in the state space.
- **Trajectory in state space**: A set of states in a state space that evolves over time from initial conditions. A single instantiation of a dynamical system.

## Why dynamical systems modeling?

- Study the mechanism of change (stability and change).
- Rationale for longitudinal research (Baltes & Nesselroade, 1979) 
    - intraindividual change
    - interindividual change in intraindividual change
    - interrelationships in behavioral change
    - determinants of intraindividual change
    - determinants of interindividual change in intraindividual change

See Cronbach & Furby, 1970, Nesselroade & Cable, 1974, Baltes & Nesselroade, 1979 for a historical accounting of studying change.
